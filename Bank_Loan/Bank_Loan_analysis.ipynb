    "In this project, I checked the file of the data frame to understand the type of data that I need to work with and what kind of information I can pull out of it.  I started to read the general information about the data frame, where I noticed the missing values for the 'days_employed' and 'total_income' columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "After taking notes about those two columns, I checked the data frame for any 0 values and if they are relevant to where they exist. Meaning it was relevant to find them in the 'children' column, but irrelevant to find them in the 'dob_year' column. I made a research on all the columns and I found out the following: \n",
    "The data of the column 'days_employed' is messy and irrelevant to the project.\n",
    "the 'total_income' has missing values.\n",
    "'dob_years' column has 0 values and it needs to be replaced.\n",
    "The 'education' column, has a lot of duplicated and unorganized text formats.\n",
    "There is a negative value in the 'children' column, and that's irrelevant. \n",
    "First, I dropped the 'days_employed' column from the data frame, since it has no use in this project. The data could be fixed although, it would be still not relevant to the project tasks. This type of data should be reported to the engineers to understand that there might be something wrong since it has a lot of messy information and is not clear. \n",
    "Next, I filled the missing values in the 'total_income' column by the median of the 'income_type'. That means if the work is civil servant, the missing value for a civil servant would be the median of all the civil servant incomes of the non-missing values. That also applied to all the 'income_type' categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "I calculated the mean of the 'dob_years' and I replaced the 0 values with it. \n",
    "The negative value in the 'children' column I replaced with the 1 value because apparently, the value was a typo during the data entry.\n",
    " Now I finished the data preprocessing, but I checked once again if there are any missing values, and regarding the results, there were no missing values. \n",
    "The 'total_income' is a 'float64' data type, I converted it to an integer by using the astype() method. Converting the column to an integer would make it easier to read and to work within the matter of calculations. \n",
    "As I said before, the 'education ' had a lot of duplicated data and messy text formats. Therefore, I applied the str. lower() method that would take all the strings to a lowercase text and will combine the duplicates. So, I ended up having 5 categories only in the 'education' column.\n",
    "After cleaning the data and filling in the missing values, I needed to categorize the following columns:\n",
    "'purpose' column: The loan purpose column contains sentences that tell what is the reason for getting a loan. The problem here is the similarity in the purpose but not in the text. However, there are common words that I could notice between the purposes. \n",
    "'income_total' column: The income column has a huge range between the numbers of income. That makes it hard to have a clearer image of the effects of income on the loan. Therefore, the best way is to have small and specific categories for certain ranges in income. \n",
    "In the 'purpose' column I applied a function to read the text from it and compare the text if it has certain words in it. I used the If statement, I saw it easier and faster to build, since we don't have a huge amount of text. Then the results were saved on the 'purpose_cat' column. The result was 4 categories: Real Estate, Car, Education and Wedding. \n",
    "\n",
    "I made a small research on google to know more about the general amount of minimum wage. That to help me categorize the 'total_income' column. However, I also printed the describe() table of the column. Therefore, I can get to know more about the content. The minimum wage was close enough to the std in the table, and the medium wage was relevant to the mean amount in the table. Therefore, I made an if statement to check the 'total income' and categorize it by either: Poor, Medium, or Rich, and it was saved on the 'income_cat' column. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have a clean data set and categorized, for the last section I needed to answer some questions to analyze the data. \n",
    "In all those questions, I used the Pivot table, to check relations between values in different columns. Then I calculated the ratio to get the actual percentage.\n",
    " I will answer the questions briefly here since I answered them in detail in the previous section. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Questions:  \n",
    "Is there a relation between having kids and repaying a loan on time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Families with 4 children have a percentage of 9.75% to not pay on time. \n",
    "Families with no children have a percentage of 7.51% to not pay on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a relation between marital status and repaying a loan on time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unmarried with the highest percentage of 9.73% to not pay on time.\n",
    "A widow or a widower with the lowest percentage of 6.56% to not pay on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a relation between income level and repaying a loan on time?\n",
    "\n",
    "The medium level has the highest percentage to not pay on time 8.51%\n",
    "The rich level has the lowest percentage to not pay on time 7.59%\n",
    "\n",
    "How do different loan purposes affect on-time repayment of the loan?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Car purpose has 9.32% chance to not pay the loan on time\n",
    "The real estate purpose has 7.21% chance to not pay the loan on time. \n"
